# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# Learning GitHub Repository

This repository is created solely for the purpose of learning GitHub and its concepts. It serves as a playground to experiment with various GitHub features and workflows.

## Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to tell jokes. It utilizes the [JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) to fetch random jokes. Whenever the page is reloaded, a new joke is displayed. 

## How it works

The project fetches jokes from the JokeAPI using the endpoint `https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any?type=single` and displays them dynamically on the page. This serves as a practical example to understand how to integrate external APIs into a project.

Feel free to contribute, experiment, or learn from this repository!
